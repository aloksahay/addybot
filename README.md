# addybot

Addy, is a motivation tool designed for developers, especially those with attention deficit disorders, to help maintain focus on tasks by minimizing distractions like social media notifications. Users can log in via a social login using web3auth, which gives them an embedded wallet with testnet funds. The app syncs with Notion to manage a list of tasks, prioritizing them and breaking them into focus sessions using AI. This setup encourages work sessions by displaying progress through GitHub polling and offering a summary of the time spent focusing. Additionally, Addy presents focus rooms as NFTs, which can be purchased on MANTLE and serve as visual skins for the focus environment. The app's revenue model is based on selling these digital collectibles rather than subscriptions. Future developments include adding more daily stats and in-app purchases.
